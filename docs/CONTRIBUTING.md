# Contributing

- Every PR should address an issue on the repository or JIRA. If the issue doesn't exist, please create it first.
- Pull requests should always follow the following naming convention: 
`[issue-number]-[pr-name]`. 
- After your PR is merged to master:
    - Delete the branch.
    - Mark the issue it addresses with the `merged-to-master` label.
    - Close the issue **only** if the change was released.
